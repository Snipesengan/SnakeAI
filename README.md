# SnakeAI

## Objective
Create a functioning snake game. Then __train__ some sort of machine learning based artificial
intelligence.


## Agendas
1. Create some sort of "MAP" for the game
2. Create a snake class, things like velocity, position.
3. Some assumptions for the training. The AI can see everything. (Is this a good thing?)





NOTE:
This is my first time doing something like this.
